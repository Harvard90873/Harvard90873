# Relentless Exploration
- ðŸ‘‹   Hi, Iâ€™m Tim
- ðŸ‘€   Iâ€™m interested in software engineering, artificial intelligence.
- ðŸŒ±   Iâ€™m currently learning computer science on my own.

The software industry is a big one, there's tons of things to explore, and I'm determined to keep going as long as I have a computer.

I've got a few projects I'm proud of, take a look if interested.
